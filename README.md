# *ProducerConsumerVertx*


## Running the project 
1.  inside the application.properties file change configuration : 

    1. cmd = location of execuatable  in the running env 
    2. supportDuplication , choose if the system should be idempotent (based on assumption if events e1,e2 in t1 and there timestamp should be equal  )
     
2. build the project (from the directory pom.xml do mvn clean install )

3. do java -jar producerConsumerVertx-1.2.4.RELEASE.jar 

## Rest Api
  rest api via vertx which goes and query the concurrent hash map for count  can be added by typing(GET method ... ) 

1.   http://localhost:8080/v1/type/count/:id  e.g: http://localhost:8080/v1/type/count/foo
2.   http://localhost:8080/v1/data/count/:id e.g: http://localhost:8080/v1/data/count/amet 


# Things to improve : 

1.  the data should be passed between producer and consumer via messagebroker such as rabbitmq or kafka  which will provide 
    1.  persistence in case of server down
    2.  monitoring how many messages are stack 
    3.  provide distributed data center so we can scale out the services     
2.  consumer data should be stored in an acid database (2 threads 1 reader and 1 writer , shared resource that should be saved )
3.  tests , I didnt want to waste my time  ...
4.  better logging
